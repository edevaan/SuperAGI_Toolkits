## Full API spec



## Shared Knowledge

'__init__.py' might contain shared constants and configurations used across multiple modules in the project.

## Anything UNCLEAR

It is unclear what specific features and capabilities are expected from the SuperAGI custom tools. Further clarification on the SuperAGI API's functionality and how it integrates with the custom tools would be beneficial.
